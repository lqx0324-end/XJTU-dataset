# XJTU-dataset
The XJTU dataset includes bitemporal HSIs and reference change map.
We used laboratory-developed hyperspectral camera, MINI-ORRIS [1, 2], to obtain the bitemporal HSIs and produced a corresponding change reference map. The scene covered the ground with cardboard boxes, frisbees, tablets, plastic boxes, and toy cars. In order to generate richer change information, the area of dashed lines in the image was copied to the area of solid boxes. Labels are obtained in ENVI by labeling pixel by pixel according to the actual scene of the shot.
